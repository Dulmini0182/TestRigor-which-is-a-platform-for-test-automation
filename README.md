🧪 Example: Login Test Case

Here’s how TestRigor expresses tests in simple steps:

✅ Passed Checks

When login is successful, TestRigor verifies expected elements:

check that page contains "Time"

check that page contains "My Info"

check that page contains "PIM"

check that page contains "Claim"

check that page contains "Buzz"

❌ Failed Checks

If expected elements are missing, tests fail with clear reports:
